MVC Architecture:

Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It handles data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
View: Represents the user interface and presentation of the application. It displays data and receives user input.
Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It processes user input, updates the Model, and updates the View accordingly.
CRUD Operations:

Create: Adding new data to the system.
Read: Retrieving and displaying data.
Update: Modifying existing data.
Delete: Removing data from the system.
Structured Elegance:

Implies that your project has a well-organized and clean code structure, following best practices and design patterns.
